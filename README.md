# Batch

Scripts, Tools and Sample Jobs
High performance computing and throughput oriented batch computing are expect to perform at scale and with speed. Many workloads, such as drug discovery and genomics, financial services and VFX rendering require access to a large and diverse set of computing resources on demand. With more and faster computing power, you can convert an idea into a discovery, a hypothesis into a cure or an inspiration into a product. Google Cloud provides customers with flexible, on-demand access to large amounts of cutting edge high-performance resources with Compute Engine.

Batch is a fully-managed cloud service for managing HPC, AI/ML, and data processing batch workloads on Google Cloud in a cloud-native manner. With the introduction of Batch, we seek to work with the community to define a new way to do batch computing that is cloud optimized.

This public preview release focuses on bringing traditional batch scheduler functionality into a cloud-first world. Simply focus on your workload and let Google Cloud manage the infrastructure and lifecylce of the resources. To the end-user Batch presents a familiar interface that supports well-understood batch concepts, including

* Support for submitting shell scripts as batch jobs
* Support for containerized batch jobs
* The ability to easily specify resources required by a job (vCPU, memory, GPUs, disks)
* Retries and Priorities
* This repository contains scripts, tools and sample jobs for use with Batch.
